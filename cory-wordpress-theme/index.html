        <h1><a href="#GettingStarted">Getting Started</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>

        <p>This document covers the installation, set up, and use of this theme, and provides answers and solutions to common problems. We encourage you to first read this document thoroughly if you are experiencing any difficulties before contacting our support team.</p> 

        <h2>Uploading Through WordPress</h2>
        <p>To upload through your Dashboard, select “Appearance” and then “Themes”. Next, select the “Install Themes” tab at the top of the page and then select the “Upload” link, right above the search field. Choose your file and select “Install Now”. Once the theme is fully uploaded and installed, click “Activate” to activate the WordPress theme.</p>
        <blockquote>The theme files will be stored on your server in the <code>wp-content/themes</code> location.</blockquote>
        <p>When uploading your theme with the installer, please ensure you are uploading the theme .zip file, not the entire package you downloaded. In this case, you will be uploading coryWPtheme.zip.</p>

        <h2>FTP Upload</h2>
        <p>To manually upload your new WordPress theme, login with your credentials to your website and locate the wp-content folder in your WordPress install files. Upload the <b>un-zipped</b> Cory WordPress Theme folder into the: wp-content/themes folder. </p>
        <p>Once uploaded, activate the theme by heading to the “Themes” menu in the WordPress Dashboard. Locate the Cory WordPress Theme theme and hit “Activate”.</p>

        <p>Looking for a good, free FTP solution - why not try <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a> or <a href="https://cyberduck.io/?l=en">CyberDuck</a></p>

        <h2>Installing Theme Plugins</h2>
        <p>Once the theme is installed, you will see a notice detailing a number of plugins which should be installed. Installing of these items is very simple - just click "Begin Installing Plugins" and on the following screen you can have the theme install and activate all the plugins for you.</p>

        <img src="images/setup2.gif">

        <p>Once done you will see a notice informing you the operation is complete.</p>

        <img src="images/setup3.png">

        <h2>Importing the Demo Data</h2>
        <p>Once the plugins have been installed and activated, you are now ready to import the demo data. We use the One Click Demo Data plugin to make the process very easy for you. To begin, head to "Appearance" and then "Import Demo Data" and you will be taken to the import screen. From there hit "Begin Importing Demo Data" and the theme will grab the demo content and set it up for you.</p>

    <section id="ThemeOptions">

        <h1><a href="#ThemeOptions">Theme Options</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>
        <p>To access the theme options, you may select the Customize button in the admin bar dropdown or select <code>"Customize"</code> from the Dashboard menu. Note that you must be logged in as a site administrator in order to access the controls.</p>

        <h2>Theme Options</h2>
        <h3>1 - Update Settings</h3>

        <p>Using your Envato username and API details, you can enable automatic updated for your theme (giving you a simple single-click method for updating your theme, similar to a theme hosted on the wordpress.org repository. For details on setting this up, please see the video guide below.</p>

        <iframe width="660" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqE3RE5TKJk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br><br>

        <h3>2 - Site Identity</h3>
        <p>Here you can specify a site title, tagline and favicon (the small icon shown in your browser window) and more crucially, your own custom logo.</p>

        <p>Setting up your own logo is very simple - just use the uploader provided and you can either choose an image from your media library, or upload something fresh, its up to you.</p>

        <h3>3 - Colours</h3>
        <p>These options give you a range of colour pickers which allow you to tweak the themes colour scheme to suit your tastes. Any changes you make here will be seen live so you can see exactly what each option does as your changing them.</p>

        <img src="images/options1.png">

        <h3>4 - Background Image</h3>
        <p>Want to use your own image instead of a solid colour? No problem - simply use this option to upload your own image.</p>

        <h3>5 - Menus & Widgets</h3>
        <p>Here you can setup and edit your navigation and widgets, however, given the cramped nature of the WP Customizer, we recommend using WP's dedicated page found under the "Appearance" area in your Dashboard, which not olny gives you much more room to work with, but also a simpler interface - but this is of course totally up to you and your preference.</p>

        <h3>6 - Additional CSS</h3>
        <p>For those of you our there who want to apply your own custom bespoke styling, our themes provide you with a custom CSS area where you can quickly and easily apply your own custom CSS.</p>

        <p>If your looking to make larger changes, or add a LOT of custom code, we highly recommend using a child theme - see below for details on getting this setup</p>

        <h3>7 - Portfolio Settings</h3>
        <p>Here you can control the archive layout for your portfolio items by choosing from one of our awesome layouts.</p>

    <section id="CreatingMenus">

        <h1><a href="#CreatingMenus">Creating Menus</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>
        <p>Creating menus within WordPress is very simple, and WP gives you a couple of methods to do this. We suggest using the dedicated menu page found under Appearance > Menus, however you are also free to use the menu management system found within the theme customizer/options page (Appearance > Customize)</p>

        <h3>Creating Menus</h3>

        <p>Once you’re viewing the Menus, the process of creating a menu is quite easy - essentially you create your menu item from the columns on the left (this can be a link to a post, page or other form of content) or even a custom link using the "Custom Link" menu item, you can see both in the image below. Once you have created your perfect menu, be sure to assign it to the Standard Navigation area and hit save to see it in action.</p>

        <img src="images/menus1.png">
        <br><br>

        <h3>Creating Dropdown Menus</h3>
        <p>An important aspect to note when using our theme is the process of creating dropdowns/sub menus is the top level item (the menu item in the main menu area you click/hover to activate the sub-menu) needs to be a "Custom Link" menu item with a URL of just # - this allows the dropdown to work fully on both desktops and mobiles where 'hovering' is not available.</p>

        <p>You can see the process outlined below.</p>

        <img src="images/menus2.gif">

    <section id="Widgets">

        <h1><a href="#Widgets">Using Widgets</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>
        
        <p>Cory comes with two widgetized areas, the blog sidebar (shown to the side of the main post content within single posts) and the footer, which allows a number of columns of custom widget content for whatever you wish.</p>

        <p>There are a couple of ways you can get started with widgets within WP, we recommomend the dedicated admin page found under Appearance > Widgets in your WP dashboard however you can also add/edit widgets to the available widgetized areas via Appearance > Customize however this can be a little cramped with your working with many widgets at once.</p>

        <h2>Adding Widgets</h2>

        <p>When you arrive at the Widget admin page, you will be presented with an array of widgets on the left and the widgetized areas on the right, to add a widget to one of the sidebars, simply drag your desired widget over to the sidebar of your choice on the right and your all set. From there simply edit the widget as you wish (depending on the widget your using of course) and your done.</p>

    <section id="UsingElementor">

        <h1><a href="#UsingElementor">Using Elementor</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>
        <p>The theme uses the popular WordPress page building tool, Elementor, to allow you to quickly and easily create stunning pages. We provide some example in our pre-built demo data for you to get started with and study, but creating your own from scratch is a breeze too.</p>

        <blockquote>
            Before getting started, for the best experience with Elementor and Cory, head to Elementor > Settings in your WordPress Dashboard and disable Elementor's colours and fonts by checking the boxes provided.
            <br>
        <img src="images/elementor0.png"></blockquote>

        <p>To begin, create a fresh page under Pages > Add New in your WordPress Dashboard. From there, simply hit the large "Edit with Elementor" button to beging working with the plugin.</p>

        <img src="images/elementor1.png">
        <br><br>

        <p>Building is very simple with Elementor, for a guide on how it works check out the Video Tutorial below. For more on how to use the plugin be sure to <a href="https://docs.elementor.com/" target="_blank">check out the Elementor Documention also.</a></p>

        <h2>Creating a Portfolio Project</h2>
        <p>To begin creating your portfolio projects, head to Portfolio > Add New in your WordPress Dashboard.</p>

        <img src="images/portfolio1.gif">
        <br><br>

        <p>Creating a project is very similar to a regular WordPress post, in essense you have the regular content area (where you could write a description of your work/your process etc), and gallery area where you can upload the images of your awesome project, and a featured image area (the featured image, much like a regular WP post, used to represent your portfolio item within Portfolio feeds and archive pages/searches etc. We will now detail each area.</p>

        <h2>Featured Content Images</h2>
        <p>This is where you will add your images to the projects by clicking the "Add or Upload Files" button - from there you can either upload fresh images or pick some awesome shots from your exisiting media library. To rearrange the photos, simply drag them into the order you want! Dont for get to update your project once done though.</p>

        <img src="images/portfolio2.png">
        <br><br>

        <h2>Featured Image</h2>
        <p>Upload a featured image - any size will work though we recommend <strong>700 x 420px</strong>. The images will be automatically applied throughout all the neccessary templates and loops so be sure to pick the best shot to reprasent your work.</p>

        <p>Contact Form 7 is our recommended form plugin for WordPress. It is a simple but powerful form creator for WordPress. Here we will show you how to use Contact Form 7 to create and edit a basic form.</p>

        <p>After Contact Form 7 is installed, you’ll find a new menu item in your WordPress admin area called Contact, here is where your forms and created and edited. From the Contact main screen, you will see your first contact form, its usually a default form called 'Contact Form 1' OR if you have imported the demo data for our theme you may see a few forms that we have made specially for you.</p>

        <p>When creating and editing forms CF7 uses simple shortcodes (in WordPress these shortcodes are words surrounded by square brackets like “[” and “]”) - these shortcodes are generated via the 'Generate Tag' area (marked in red) and then placed in the form builder area (marked in blue) - you can also add your own HTML to the form for extra control.<p/>

        <h2>Im seeing a 'stylesheet missing' error when trying to upload the theme</h2>
        <p>This means your uploading the wrong zip package. When downloading your theme you have the option to download the full package, or the installable theme itself.</p>
        <img src="images/common1.png">
        <br><br>
        <p>We suggest to download the whole package, then unzip this to locate your theme.zip file (theme name will change based on your purchased theme.</p>

In some cases, installing this plugin and work very well https://wordpress.org/plugins/increase-upload-max-filesize/ however if it fails to work then you will need to contact your hosts to they can make the necessary changes from there end as this is something we cannot help with from a theme point of view.We suggest

        <h2>Where is my Visual Composer/Revolution license?</h2>
        <p>Premium plugins such as Revolution Slider and Visual Composer may request a purchase code during use. This code is used to provide direct updates and support from the plugins creator and as such is not required or supplied for use with our themes. Our frameworks have been carefully create to ensure your running the latest compatible version at all times, so you have no need to worry. Please note that we manually update our bundled plugins after thorough testing as some plugin updates have bugs that we are unhappy to ship to our customers, you will receive updates when we are happy with the plugin. If you truly require auto-updates from these plugins you’ll need to purchase a personal license, please note this is the same for each theme on themeforest that bundles plugins.</p>

        <h2>Im getting a 404 error when viewing my portfolio/team etc</h2>
        <p>WordPress is a rock solid platform in most cases, but sometimes, when working with a new theme for instance, it needs a little nudge to update all of its core settings etc. If your seeing a 404 error or such when trying to view your projects (or team members, clients etc - depending on your theme)</p>

        <p>To do this, simply head to Settings > Permalinks and select 'postname' from the options listed - even if this option is already selected, hit save anyway (this is the nudge we mentioned earlier) - Once done, you should be able to view all your content with no issues.</p>

        <p>Should any issues remain, this indicates an issue with your server (the theme has no control of this) so you will need to contact your hosts for further support.</p>

        <h2>Check for Updates</h2>
        <p>To check your theme version, click the live changelog link below and check the version number at the top of the changelog.txt file:</p>
        <p><a href="@@changelogUrl" target="blank">View the Cory WordPress Theme theme changelog &rarr;</a></p>
        <p>Relay the changelog version at the top of that changelog.txt file with the version in your WordPress Dashboard > Appearance > Themes section to see if your theme files are up to date.</p>

        <p>If you are in need of the update, download the current build from the location you purchased the theme from (either ThemeForest, Creative Market or via your account dashboard) to install the updated theme.</p>

        <blockquote>If you have an active license key applied to your theme, you will receive live update notifications to which allows one-click updates directly from your WordPress dashboard.</blockquote>

        <h2>FTP Updating</h2>
        <p>If you have not customized the original theme files then you may simply drop the updated theme folder contents into the theme folder on your server – which is located in wp-content/themes/@@slug.</p>
        <p>If you wish to upload the entire updated theme as a separate theme, ensure you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rename the updated theme’s folder (different from the current theme)</li>
            <li>Drop the renamed theme folder into wp-content/themes</li>
            <li>Switch to the new theme via your WordPress Dashboard</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you choose to upload the whole theme and switch to it, you may lose your Theme Customizer data and will have to add those back in.</p>

        <h2>FTP Selective Updating</h2>
        <p>On the other hand, if you have customized some files in the core theme contents, you should consider selective updating, which simply means updating only the files that are pointed out in the theme’s changelog.</p>
        <p>There are a couple programs out there that will allow you to compare versions of files, in order to catch customizations you may not remember. Some recommended programs are <a href="http://winmerge.org/">WinMerge</a> (Windows), <a href="http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/">Kaleidoscope</a> (OSX), and handy GitHub <a href="http://mac.github.com/">(OSX)</a> & <a href="http://windows.github.com/">(Windows)</a>.</p>

        <h2>Recommended</h2>
        <p>Overall, the safest and cleanest way to update your theme is to leave your currently modified theme on your server/site as is, rename the folder of the newly updated theme, upload the new theme, and modify that to match your original custom work. In this way, if something has gone wrong with the new version, you’re just a few clicks away from getting things back to how they originally were.</p>

    <section id="ChildTheme">

        <h1><a href="#ChildTheme">Cory WordPress Theme Child Theme</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>
        <p>A child theme is a theme that inherits the functionality and styling of another theme, called the parent theme. Child themes are <b>the recommended way of modifying an existing theme</b>.</p>

        <h2>Why use a Child Theme?</h2>
        <p>There are one main reason why you would want to use a child theme: <b>If you modify a theme directly and it is updated, then your modifications <u>WILL</u> be lost.</b> By using a child theme you will ensure that your modifications are preserved.</p>

        <h2>Installing the Child theme</h2>
        <p>Log in to your site's administration panel, and go to Administration Panels > Appearance > Themes. Click "Add New" and follow the directions to upload the <cite>@@slug-child.zip</cite> file, located in the <cite>@@slug-package/theme/</cite> folder.</p><p>Next simply click "Activate" and both the Cory WordPress Theme theme and Cory WordPress Theme child theme will be active on your WordPress site. Now you're ready to customize away.</p>

        <blockquote>Note that this is the same exact method we referred to in the <a href="#GettingStarted">Getting Started</a> section of this guide. You should see your child theme listed and ready for activation.</blockquote>

        <h2>Customizing Template Files</h2>
        <p>If you want to change more than just the stylesheet, your child theme can override any file in the parent theme: simply include a file of the same name in the child theme directory, and <u>it will override the equivalent file</u> in the parent theme directory when your site loads.</p><p>For instance, if you want to change the PHP code for the site header, you can include a header.php in your child theme's directory, and that file will be used instead of the parent theme's header.php.</p>

        <h2>Child Theme Functions.php</h2>
        <p>Unlike style.css, the functions.php of a child theme does not override its counterpart from the parent. Instead, it is loaded in addition to the parent’s functions.php. (Specifically, it is loaded right before the parent’s file.)</p>

        <p>In that way, the functions.php of a child theme provides a smart, trouble-free method of modifying the functionality of a parent theme.</p>

        <h2>Adding PHP Functions</h2>
        <p>Say that you want to add a PHP function to your theme. The fastest way would be to open the @@slug/functions.php file and put the function there... <b>But that’s not smart:</b> The next time Cory WordPress Theme is updated, your function will disappear (as the entire contents of the /@@slug/ folder are replaced upon an update.</p><p>However, there is an alternative way which is the smart way: you can create a child theme, add a functions.php file in it, and add your function to that file. The function will do the exact same job from there too, with the advantage that it will not be affected by future updates of the parent theme.</p>

        <blockquote><b>DO NOT</b> copy the full content of functions.php of the parent theme into functions.php in the child theme. It's not a good practice by any means.</blockquote>

        <h2>Modifiying PHP Functions</h2>
        <p>You can use this same exact methodology to modify functions that are within the parent theme's files. Let's take a quick look at an example.</p>

        <p>Below is an example of a typical function within most of our WordPress themes - a template tag that pulls in the site archives.</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/richtabor/c2a8df58824504fb06da0e77e4db34c6.js"></script>

        <p>Say you wanted to change the titles of each section (<em>Monthly, Yearly, Categories</em>). You would find this function (located in the @@slug/inc/template-tags.php file) then copy it over to the child theme like such:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/richtabor/34887856b1192088de0ca0585e8876b2.js"></script>

        <p>And then edit the text as you see fit. This function will load before the one in the theme, which is pluggable —that is, replaceable by a child theme— conditionally. </p>

        <blockquote>Note that this example is for this specifcic function, buy you can do the same with any pluggable function that contains the following:</blockquote>

    <section id="Developers">

        <h1><a href="#Developers">Developers</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>
        <p>If you'd like to add another menu location to use in the theme, search for the <code>@@slug_setup</code> function in your theme's functions.php file and copy that whole function to your child theme.</p>

        <p>Within the <code>@@slug_setup</code> function you'll see the standard <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_nav_menus/" target="blank">register_nav_menus</a> function. Simply create another copy/paste another line with a unique location identifiers and name. The code below creates two separate menus locations that are selectable via the <code>WP Dashboard > Appearance > Menu</code> page. </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/richtabor/57104857bede24c7bc8a.js"></script>

        <h3>Adding your menu to the theme.</h3>
        <p>Now that you've created the menu, you can use it in your theme's files. As always, we suggest utilizing a child theme to make file modifications.</p>

        <p>The code below is an example of the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_nav_menu/" target="blank">wp_nav_menu</a> function that displays your created navigation window. There is quite a few parameters associated with this function, so take a look at it's official <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_nav_menu/" target="blank">reference</a> to see all that you can do.</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/richtabor/f83dca778d3f330012d0.js"></script>       

        <h2>Add Image Sizes</h2>
        <p>If you'd like to add another image size for your WordPress instance to automatically size for, search for the <code>@@slug_setup</code> function in your theme's functions.php file and copy that whole function to your child theme (if you have not already done so).</p>

        <p>You'll want to look for <code>add_image_size</code> within the <code>@@slug_setup</code> function and copy/paste a new line in. Below is an example of the <code>add_image_size</code> function.</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/richtabor/1f84b7e974907a6f8338.js"></script>

        <p>Note that the first numeral value is the image's width and the second is the height. <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_image_size/" target="blank">Read more</a> about the parameters of the <code>add_image_size</code> function on the WordPress reference site.</p>

        <h3>Using image_size in your theme.</h3>
        <p>It's pretty simple to utilize your new image size within your theme templates. Here's an example using the above <code>add_image_size</code> function.</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/richtabor/c0351b6b6c435a5466fd.js"></script>

        <blockquote>Note that you will need to <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/" target="blank">regenerate your images</a> if you're trying to create an image size for images already uploaded to your WordPress Media Library.</blockquote>
