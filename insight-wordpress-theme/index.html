        <h1><a href="#Welcome">Welcome</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>

        <h1><a href="#GettingStarted">Getting Started</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>

        <p>This document covers the installation, set up, and use of this theme, and provides answers and solutions to common problems. We encourage you to first read this document thoroughly if you are experiencing any difficulties before contacting our support team.</p> 

        <h2>Uploading Through WordPress</h2>
        <p>To upload through your Dashboard, select âAppearanceâ and then âThemesâ. Next, select the âInstall Themesâ tab at the top of the page and then select the âUploadâ link, right above the search field. Choose your file and select âInstall Nowâ. Once the theme is fully uploaded and installed, click âActivateâ to activate the WordPress theme.</p>
        <blockquote>The theme files will be stored on your server in the <code>wp-content/themes</code> location.</blockquote>
        <p>When uploading your theme with the installer, please ensure you are uploading the theme .zip file, not the entire package you downloaded. In this case, you will be uploading InsightWPtheme.zip.</p>

        <img src="images/upload1.gif">

        <h2>FTP Upload</h2>
        <p>To manually upload your new WordPress theme, login with your credentials to your website and locate the wp-content folder in your WordPress install files. Upload the <b>un-zipped</b> Insight WordPress Theme folder into the: wp-content/themes folder. </p>
        <p>Once uploaded, activate the theme by heading to the âThemesâ menu in the WordPress Dashboard. Locate the Insight WordPress Theme theme and hit âActivateâ.</p>

        <p>Looking for a good, free FTP solution - why not try <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a> or <a href="https://cyberduck.io/?l=en">CyberDuck</a></p>

    <section id="FallbackSetup">

        <h1><a href="#FallbackSetup">Fallback Setup</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>

        <p>Although we take the greatest care to make the setup process as simple as possible, in some cases (esspecially on budget hosting where resources and at a bare minimum) you may experience an issue during the automatic setup - this section covers an alternative fallback method you can use should the need arise.</p> 

        <h2>Importing The Demo Data Manually</h2>
        <p>The first thing we need to clarify is setting up manually will mean things like widgets and theme options wont be setup for you - this is unavoidable but it will still give you a great base of all the demo pages ready for you to start building your new site.</p>
        <p>To begin, install <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/attachment-importer/">Attachment Importer</a> - this is a lightweight importing tool for images and will be needed later on to import the demo images/media. Once done, head to Tools > Import and select WordPress to open up WPs built in importing tool (you may need to install it to continue)</p>

        <img src="images/fallback1.gif">

        <h2>Uploading the XML File</h2>
        <p>Next you will need to locate the themes demo-data.xml file, this will be included in the Demo Data folder in your main download package. Once located select this file and hit "upload". Next you will see a page which will allow you to choose if you wish to assign the demo posts to another user, as well as an option to import all media and attachments - <strong>be sure to leave this box unchecked</strong> as we will be taking care of this later (and want the import to be as light as possible to be more likley to work)</p>

        <img src="images/fallback2.png">

        <p>Once done you will see a notice informing you the operation is complete.</p>

        <img src="images/fallback3.png">

        <h2>Importing the Images</h2>
        <p>Now you have the pages imported, its time to tackle the images. If you have not already done so, install and activate <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/attachment-importer/">Attachment Importer</a> and once done, head to Tools > Import and select the newly added Attachment Import from the list of tools to continue.</p>       

        <img src="images/fallback4.gif">
        <br><br>

        <p>Once here, locate the demo XML file and upload - once done hit "Import" and allow the process to take place. Depending on the number of images this process will take some time, so be sure to leave your browser alone whilst its happening (though you can of course open another tab and continue to browse freely)</p>

        <iframe width="660" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W2oQ7iDc8u0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br><br>

        <h2>Final Step</h2>
        <p>Ok so you now have the pages and images all imported and ready, you now need to simply setup your homepage/blog and menu. To do this head to Settings > Reading to choose your homepage and posts page, and then head to Appearance > Menus to assign the demo menus.</p>   

    </section>  

    <section id="ThemeOptions">

        <h1><a href="#ThemeOptions">Theme Options</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>
        <p>To access the theme options, you may select the Customize button in the admin bar dropdown or select <code>"Customize"</code> from the Dashboard menu. Note that you must be logged in as a site administrator in order to access the controls.</p>

        <h2>Theme Options</h2>

        <img src="images/options1.png">
        <br><br>

        <h3>1 - Site Identity</h3>
        <p>Here you can specify a site title, tagline and favicon (the small icon shown in your browser window) and more crucially, your own custom logo.</p>

        <p>Setting up your own logo is very simple - just use the uploader provided and you can either choose an image from your media library, or upload something fresh, its up to you.</p>

        <p>When uploading a logo the ideal size you should aim for is <strong>200px x 62px</strong></p>

        <h3>2 - Colours</h3>
        <p>This area allows you to specify the background colour used in your site.</p>

        <h3>3 - Background Image</h3>
        <p>Want to use your own image instead of a solid colour? No problem - simply use this option to upload your own image.</p>

        <h3>4 - Menus & Widgets</h3>
        <p>Here you can setup and edit your navigation and widgets, however, given the cramped nature of the WP Customizer, we recommend using WP's dedicated page found under the "Appearance" area in your Dashboard, which not olny gives you much more room to work with, but also a simpler interface - but this is of course totally up to you and your preference.</p>

        <h3>5 - Additional CSS</h3>
        <p>For those of you our there who want to apply your own custom bespoke styling, our themes provide you with a custom CSS area where you can quickly and easily apply your own custom CSS.</p>

        <p>If your looking to make larger changes, or add a LOT of custom code, we highly recommend using a child theme - see below for details on getting this setup</p>

        <h3>6 - Style Settings</h3>
        <p>Here you will find Typography settings which allow you to customize the Google font used in your theme - see the video below for details on how this works</p>

        <iframe width="660" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xaf_qlRUmNk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br><br>

        <h3>7 - Theme Colours</h3>
        <p>These options give you a range of colour pickers which allow you to tweak the themes colour scheme to suit your tastes. Any changes you make here will be seen live so you can see exactly what each option does as your changing them.</p>

        <h3>8 - Header Settings</h3>
        <p>Here you will find options to control the header global header layout, as well as settings to control the header button.</p>

        <h3>9 - Page View Settings</h3>
        <p>These options allow to you enable or disable breadcrumbs and sharing icons within regular WP pages (pages not created with the page builder)</p>

        <h1><a href="#CreatingMenus">Creating Menus</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>
        <p>Creating menus within WordPress is very simple, and WP gives you a couple of methods to do this. We suggest using the dedicated menu page found under Appearance > Menus, however you are also free to use the menu management system found within the theme customizer/options page (Appearance > Customize)</p>

        <h3>Creating Menus</h3>

        <p>Once youâre viewing the Menus, the process of creating a menu is quite easy - essentially you create your menu item from the columns on the left (this can be a link to a post, page or other form of content) or even a custom link using the "Custom Link" menu item, you can see both in the image below. Once you have created your perfect menu, be sure to assign it to the Standard Navigation area and hit save to see it in action.</p>

        <img src="images/menus1.png">
        <br><br>

        <h3>Creating Dropdown Menus</h3>
        <p>An important aspect to note when using our theme is the process of creating dropdowns/sub menus is the top level item (the menu item in the main menu area you click/hover to activate the sub-menu) needs to be a "Custom Link" menu item with a URL of just # - this allows the dropdown to work fully on both desktops and mobiles where 'hovering' is not available.</p>

        <p>You can see the process outlined below.</p>

        <p>Insight comes with two widgetized areas, the blog sidebar (shown to the side of the main post content within single posts) and the footer, which allows a number of columns of custom widget content for whatever you wish.</p>

        <p>There are a couple of ways you can get started with widgets within WP, we recommomend the dedicated admin page found under Appearance > Widgets in your WP dashboard however you can also add/edit widgets to the available widgetized areas via Appearance > Customize however this can be a little cramped with your working with many widgets at once.</p>

        <h2>Adding Widgets</h2>

        <p>When you arrive at the Widget admin page, you will be presented with an array of widgets on the left and the widgetized areas on the right, to add a widget to one of the sidebars, simply drag your desired widget over to the sidebar of your choice on the right and your all set. From there simply edit the widget as you wish (depending on the widget your using of course) and your done.</p>

        <h3>How Insight Works with WPBakery Page Builder</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Sections are Crucial</h4>
        <br>
        <p>An important feature within Insight is the use of the "section" block to house your page content. Sections provide a perfect method to keep you page contents nice and organised, but more crucially within Insight, sections (together with spcial CSS classes) are used in combination to create an array of uniquely styled areas.</p>
        <p>Using sections is very simple. To begin, simply select the section block and add it to your page, from there you can add a row, and subequently any content blocks you want.</p>

        <img src="images/sections.gif">
        <br><br>
        <h4>Adding Styling To Sections</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Once you have a section setup, you have a number of ways to apply styling to to. The 1st method would be to give the section one of our <a href="#SpecialCSSClasses">Special CSS Classes</a> this is done via the "extra class" field (see below for an example). You can also head to the "design" tab to give your section a background colour of your choice, add your own padding, and much more.</p>

        <h1><a href="#SpecialCSSClasses">Special CSS Classes</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>

        <p>Insight uses a small number of special classes which apply unique attributes to a section/row. These range from making the text within an area light in appearance, to even applying a "sticky" background image effect and more. These classes are detailed below and can be used by adding them to your section/rows via the "Extra Class" field seen below</p>

        <img src="images/cssclasses.png">

        <code>bg-dark</code> - This class gives your area a dark background colour, ideal of offsetting against a white section.
        <br><br>

        <code>bg-white</code> - This class gives your section a light-white background colour.
        <br><br>

        <code>bg-gradient</code> - This class gives your section a neat gradient background. You can also use <strong>bg-gradient-1</strong> and <strong>bg-gradient-2</strong> for different colours too.
        <br><br>

        <code>text-center</code> - This class centers the text within an element.

        <p>After Contact Form 7 is installed, youâll find a new menu item in your WordPress admin area called Contact, here is where your forms and created and edited. From the Contact main screen, you will see your first contact form, its usually a default form called 'Contact Form 1' OR if you have imported the demo data for our theme you may see a few forms that we have made specially for you.</p>

        <p>When creating and editing forms CF7 uses simple shortcodes (in WordPress these shortcodes are words surrounded by square brackets like â[â and â]â) - these shortcodes are generated via the 'Generate Tag' area (marked in red) and then placed in the form builder area (marked in blue) - you can also add your own HTML to the form for extra control.<p/>

        <h2>Using a Child Theme</h2>
        <p>If your looking to make changes to your theme such as bespoke CSS styling or modifying the loops, page templates or anything on the technical side of things - its important to use a child theme to ensure your modifications are not lost during theme updates. Thankfully, your main download package includes a ready-made child theme to get you started, however if your looking to create your own we recommend using a plugin such as <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/orbisius-child-theme-creator/" target="_blank">Child Theme Creator by Orbisius</a> which makes the process as simple as just a few clicks.</p>

        <p>For more on why usign a child theme is crucial in these situation, check out <a href="http://www.tommusrhodus.com/wp-basics-the-world-of-child-themes/" target="_blank">our blog post</a> for an in depth look.</p>

    <section id="SupportPolicy">

        <h1><a href="#SupportPolicy">Support Policy</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>

        <p>Each purchase of our themes comes with 6 months of timely, 5 star rated support which you can extend at any time. Our themes do not come with free customization work. There is a very fine line between theme support and customization and whilst weâre happy and ready to help with your theme support questions, we cannot help your modify or extend the theme beyond its advertised features &amp; capabilities.</p>

        <p>The information below will help you distinguish and understand the difference between theme support and customizations, if you then need to open a support ticket, a link is given.</p>

        <h2>Theme Support Examples</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>âMy theme is broken. Iâve followed all the necessary steps to set up the theme, including watching the install video or help documents included with the theme, but still canât get the theme to work.â</li>
            <li>âMy theme does not work as advertised. Iâve set it up as directed, but for some reason my theme doesnât look like it should.â</li>
            <li>âMy theme has an obvious bug which is preventing me from using the theme properly.â</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As you can see, theme support issues interfere with the intended functionality of the theme. These issues prevent the theme from working as advertised and will be supported.</p>

        <h2>Theme Customization Examples</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How do I change an element to look or function differently than shown in the demo?</li>
            <li>I would like to add or remove an element from the header, what do I do?</li>
            <li>A plugin not recommended/required by the theme on install breaks my theme or causes unexpected behavior.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As you can see, theme customization has to do with preference, rather than actual theme issues. It requires customizing the theme beyond the scope of the themeâs intended style or functionality. These kinds of requests cannot be fulfilled in the support forums unfortunately.</p>

        <p>We do offer paid customization services for our theme collection. Visit the <a href="https://www.tommusrhodus.com/request-a-quote/">Customizations page</a> to get started by posting your project on Codeable.</p>

        <h4>3rd Party Plugins</h4>

        <p>In a perfect world, every theme would work with every plugin. But for every great plugin out there, you have a poorly coded one. Because of this, we simply canât support every 3rd party plugin. However, we do try our best to make the themes compatible with all of the popular plugins out there, and itâs a continuing effort.</p>

        <p>That being said, we donât consider non-compatibility with plugins a theme support issue. The theme is only guaranteed to work as shown, with the plugins suggested. If you want to force compatibility, it will be up to you to work out a solution.</p>

        <h2>WordPress Novices</h2>

        <p>Everyone is a newbie at WordPress at one point or another. Weâve all struggled through the ins and outs of WordPress and spent many hours hunting down answers on Google and StackExchange.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, our support tickets are not the best place for asking general WordPress questions. Weâd happily answer every question you could throw at us, if there was enough time in the day! So we ask that you focus on asking theme-specific questions while seeking help.</p>

In some cases, installing this plugin and work very well https://wordpress.org/plugins/increase-upload-max-filesize/ however if it fails to work then you will need to contact your hosts to they can make the necessary changes from there end as this is something we cannot help with from a theme point of view.We suggest

        <h2>Where is my Visual Composer/Revolution license?</h2>
        <p>Premium plugins such as Revolution Slider and Visual Composer may request a purchase code during use. This code is used to provide direct updates and support from the plugins creator and as such is not required or supplied for use with our themes. Our frameworks have been carefully create to ensure your running the latest compatible version at all times, so you have no need to worry. Please note that we manually update our bundled plugins after thorough testing as some plugin updates have bugs that we are unhappy to ship to our customers, you will receive updates when we are happy with the plugin. If you truly require auto-updates from these plugins youâll need to purchase a personal license, please note this is the same for each theme on themeforest that bundles plugins.</p>

        <h2>Im getting a 404 error when viewing my portfolio/team etc</h2>
        <p>WordPress is a rock solid platform in most cases, but sometimes, when working with a new theme for instance, it needs a little nudge to update all of its core settings etc. If your seeing a 404 error or such when trying to view your projects (or team members, clients etc - depending on your theme)</p>

        <p>To do this, simply head to Settings > Permalinks and select 'postname' from the options listed - even if this option is already selected, hit save anyway (this is the nudge we mentioned earlier) - Once done, you should be able to view all your content with no issues.</p>

        <p>Should any issues remain, this indicates an issue with your server (the theme has no control of this) so you will need to contact your hosts for further support.</p>
